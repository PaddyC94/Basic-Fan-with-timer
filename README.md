# Basic-Fan-with-timer
This code is used to power and fan/motor fro a period of time and then turn off for a period of time while continuously looping.

The motor usied for this code is a 5V brushless motor (common) and is direcly connect to the ground and pin 3 (~PWM) other PWM pins can be used if nessacary.

This code is included on an instructables project I have been developing and its purpose is to ventilate a small chamber.
